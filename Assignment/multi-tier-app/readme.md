# Multi-Tier Application on AWS (Cloud Internship Assignment)

This project demonstrates how to create a secure multi-tier architecture on AWS using CloudFormation.  
It includes a VPC with public and private subnets, an EC2 instance in the public subnet, and an RDS MySQL database in the private subnet.

## ‚úÖ Objective

- Create a secure and scalable VPC with:
  - 1 Public Subnet
  - 1 Private Subnet
  - Internet Gateway
  - NAT Gateway
  - Route Tables
- Launch an EC2 instance in the Public Subnet.
- Launch an RDS MySQL database in the Private Subnet (no public access).
- Install MySQL client on the EC2 instance.
- Test the connection from EC2 to RDS.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Go to **AWS CloudFormation** Console.
2. Upload the `multi-tier-app.yaml` file.
3. Deploy the stack with required parameters.
4. SSH into EC2 and install MySQL client:
